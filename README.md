Project Name: djob

Who I Am: I am Doğu Kaan Sakkallı.

Project Details: A freelance job advertisement website that runs on the Internet Computer.

Vision: To enable people to easily get their jobs done for a fee in a secure manner, and for developers to earn income by doing these jobs.

Project Description: djob, written in Rust and using the Internet Computer Protocol, aims to create a reliable and user-friendly platform. Freelancers can reach people looking for jobs, and employers can find suitable talents for their projects. All transactions are conducted on the blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.

Software Development Plan:

Development of smart contracts: Smart contracts will be created for job postings and payments.

User management and security features: Features will be developed to allow users to register securely and verify their identities.

Job posting and application process: An interface will be developed for employers to create job postings and for freelancers to apply.

Payment and balance management: A system will be created for users to manage their payments and balances.

Interface and user experience improvement: Interface and experience enhancements will be made to ensure that the platform is user-friendly and accessible.

Deployment: The platform will be published on the Internet Computer and made available for use.

Story Summary: My goal is to create a blockchain-based freelance job site that enables people to easily get their jobs done and allows developers to earn 
income. This platform will help people complete their jobs quickly and securely, creating new business models and opportunities.





## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
